intro: " I'm Subash, a dedicated educational professional with a passion for creating innovative learning experiences and applying data-driven decision-making in the field of education. <br><br>

When I'm not working on data analysis or designing educational materials, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors, reading about the latest advancements in technology, brain and education or engaging in my self reflection.

Feel free to take a look at my **[portfolio](/project)**, my **[resume](https://github.com/hukkum/hukkum.github.io/blob/main/files/cvweb.pdf)** to learn more about me and my work, or **[contact me](/contact)** if you have any questions or opportunities to collaborate. <br><br>

<h3>What I am pondering upon nowadays?</h3>
- Blockchain in Education <br>
- Structural Equational Modelling Using lavaan Package<br>
- MOOCs<br>
